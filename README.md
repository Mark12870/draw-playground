## Functions

- Advanced element drawing (Dashed lines, circles, arcs)
- Transparent Background

## Konva

- Don't know how to do color transitions
- No out of the box animations

## Pixi

- No dashed line support out of the box
- Problematic events on arcs, couldn't solve correct hit areas
- No out of the box animations

##GoJS

- Pretty Expensive
- Ugly documentation examples
